INSTALL GAMMU
-------------

This is an example of Gammu installation in Ubuntu Desktop 10.4. Your have to install both playSMS and
Gammu on the same server.

There are 2 methods of installation, first is to install from source and secondly with apt-get.

I. Install Gammu from source

1. Make sure you have root access
    $ sudo su -
    # 

2. Install packages required for building Gammu from source in Ubuntu
    # apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libbluetooth-dev libmysqlclient15-dev cmake
   In most cases below command will be sufficient
    # apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev cmake

3. Navigate to Gammu source file and extract
   Please download gammu-1.28.0.tar.bz2 from http://wammu.eu and save it in /usr/local/src
    # cd /usr/local/src
    # tar -jxf gammu-1.28.0.tar.bz2

4. Enter Gammu extracted source file directory and compile them
    # cd gammu-1.28.0
    # ./configure
    # make
    # make test
    # make install

5. Create required directories (case sensitive)
    # mkdir /var/log/gammu
    # mkdir -p /var/spool/gammu/inbox
    # mkdir -p /var/spool/gammu/outbox
    # mkdir -p /var/spool/gammu/sent
    # mkdir -p /var/spool/gammu/error

6. Setup Gammu spool directories owner and permissions
   In this example your webserver user and group is www-data
    # chown www-data:www-data -R /var/spool/gammu/*
    OR
    # chmod 777 -R /var/spool/gammu/*

7. Copy [this_playsms_package]/contrib/gammu/gammu-smsdrc to /etc/
    # cp [this_playsms_package]/contrib/gammu/gammu-smsdrc /etc/
   Note: Before continue to step 8 you might want to take a look /etc/gammu-smsdrc
	 and edit the file accordingly. Do not change file or directory paths.

8. Start gammu-smsd using example script gammu_smsd_start from [this_playsms_package]/bin
    # cd [this_playsms_package]/bin
    # cp gammu_smsd_start /usr/local/bin
   Note: You might also want to put gammu_smsd_start in rc.local (/etc/rc.local)
         to get gammu-smsd started on boot

9. Run gammu_smsd_start to start gammu-smsd
    # gammu_smsd_start

II. Install with apt-get

    $ sudo su -
    # 

2. Install Gammu with apt-get
    # apt-get install gammu-smsd

3. Create required directories
    # mkdir /var/log/gammu
    # mkdir -p /var/spool/gammu/inbox
    # mkdir -p /var/spool/gammu/outbox
    # mkdir -p /var/spool/gammu/sent
    # mkdir -p /var/spool/gammu/error

4. Setup Gammu spool directories owner and permissions
   In this example your webserver user and group is www-data
    # chown www-data:www-data -R /var/spool/gammu/*
    OR
    # chmod 777 -R /var/spool/gammu/*

    # /etc/init.d/gammu-smsd start
   Note: You don't need to put the script in /etc/rc.local

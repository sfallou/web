INSTALLATION
------------
There are 2 methods available to install playSMS:
1. Using install-script
2. Step-by-step

If you are using Ubuntu server, relatively new and not much core changes, then I suggest
you to use 1st method, using install-script.


INSTALLATION on Linux using install-script
------------------------------------------
playSMS Web Interface using install script:

1.  Extract playSMS package somewhere (Usually in /usr/local/src).

    # tar -zxf playsms-x.x.x.tar.gz -C /usr/local/src

    Note: x.x.x may vary according to the package name you've download.
          For example playsms-0.9.9.tar.gz

2.  Edit install.conf, read it, understand it and make changes to suit your
    system configuration

    # cd /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/contrib/installer

    # vi install.conf

3.  Run installer script. Be warned that the script have been tested only on 
    Ubuntu server or desktop.

    # cd /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/contrib/installer

    # ./install-playsms-ubuntu.sh

    Note:
    - you must read and verify the install data presented when running
      script install-playsms-ubuntu.sh, and continue only when the data
      is correct
    - edit install.conf again if you think your install data is wrong
    - after successful installation, please run command "ps ax" and see
      if playsmsd and sendsmsd are running

      # ps ax | grep sms
      2756 ?        S      0:00 /bin/bash ./playsmsd /var/www/playsms
      2759 ?        S      0:00 /bin/bash ./sendsmsd /var/www/playsms

    - stop here and review your installation steps when playsmsd and sendsmsd aren't running
    - consider to ask question in playSMS mailing list when you encountered any problem
    - if all seems to be correctly installed you may try to login from web

      browse http://<your web server IP>/playsms/ and login using default administrator user
      username: admin
      password: admin


INSTALLATION on Linux step by step
----------------------------------
playSMS Web Interface step-by-step installation:

1.  Extract playSMS package somewhere (Usually in /usr/local/src).

    # tar -zxf playsms-x.x.x.tar.gz -C /usr/local/src

    Note: x.x.x may vary according to the package name you've download.
          For example playsms-0.9.9.tar.gz

2.  Create playSMS web root, spool and log and set ownership to user www-data or web server user

    # mkdir -p /var/www/playsms /var/spool/playsms /var/log/playsms /var/lib/playsms

    # chown -R www-data /var/www/playsms /var/spool/playsms /var/log/playsms /var/lib/playsms

    Note: There are Linux distributions using 'apache' as web server user instead of 'www-data'.

3.  Copy files and directories inside 'web' directory to playSMS web root and set ownership again to
    user www-data or web server user, just to make sure

    # cp -rR /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/web/* /var/www/playsms

    # chown -R www-data /var/www/playsms

4.  Setup database (import database)

    # mysqladmin -u root -p create playsms

    # mysql -u root -p playsms < /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/db/playsms.sql

    Note: You don't need to use MySQL root access nor this method to setup playSMS
    database, but this is beyond our scope. You should read MySQL manual for custom
    installation method or howto insert SQL statements into existing database.

5.  Copy config-dist.php to config.php and then edit config.php

    # cp /var/www/playsms/config-dist.php /var/www/playsms/config.php

    # vi /var/www/playsms/config.php

    Note: Please read and fill all fields with correct values

6.  Enter daemon/linux directory, copy playsms, playsmsd* and sendsmsd*

    # mkdir -p /etc/default /usr/local/bin

    # cp /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/daemon/linux/etc/playsms /etc/default/

    # cp /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/daemon/linux/bin/* /usr/local/bin/

7.  Just to make sure every paths are correct, please edit /etc/default/playsms

    # vi /etc/default/playsms

    Note: Make sure that PLAYSMS_PATH is pointing to a correct playSMS installation path (in this example
    to /var/www/playsms), and also make sure that PLAYSMS_BIN is pointing to a correct playSMS daemon 
    scripts path (in this example to /usr/local/bin)

8.  There are two choices to get playSMS daemon starts automatically on every boot. You need to choose one

    A. Using init script. When you are installing playSMS on Debian based distro (like Ubuntu), you may use
       contributed init script. Copy the init script to /etc/init.d/ and program it to start at boot

       # cp /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/daemon/linux/etc/playsms.init-ubuntu /etc/init.d/playsms

       # update-rc.d playsms defaults

    B. Using rc.local. Look for rc.local on /etc, /etc/init.d or /etc/rc.d/init.d
       When you found it edit that rc.local and put:

       "/usr/local/bin/playsmsd_start" (without quotes, remove quotes)

       on the bottom of the file (before exit if theres an exit command). This way playsmsd_start
       will start automatically on boot.

    Note: Just like any other steps before, you need 'root' access to do this.

9. Start playsmsd manually, no need to reboot your OS

    A. If you are using the init script:

       # /etc/init.d/playsms start

    B. If you are using rc.local:

       # /usr/local/bin/playsmsd_start

    Note:
    - after successful installation, please run command "ps ax" and see 
      if playsmsd and sendsmsd are running

      # ps ax | grep sms
      2756 ?        S      0:00 /bin/bash ./playsmsd /var/www/playsms
      2759 ?        S      0:00 /bin/bash ./sendsmsd /var/www/playsms

    - stop here and review your installation steps when playsmsd and sendsmsd aren't running
    - consider to ask question in playSMS mailing list when you encountered any problem
    - if all seems to be correctly installed you may try to login from web

      browse http://<your web server IP>/playsms/ and login using default administrator user
      username: admin
      password: admin


Please continue to follow INSTALL_SMSSERVERTOOLS to use SMS Server Tools (smstools3) as your gateway
module, or follow INSTALL_KANNEL if you want to use Kannel instead.

Gnokii and Gammu also supported, please follow INSTALL_GNOKII if you want to use Gnokii as your
gateway module, or INSTALL_GAMMU if you want to use Gammu instead.

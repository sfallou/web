INSTALL GNOKII
--------------
If you want to use default gateway module (gnokii), then you must install gnokii on the 
same server where playSMS installed. 

There are 2 choices how to install gnokii, first using apt-get and secondly by downloading 
the source and compile it. Choose one easiest.

I.  Gnokii installation in Ubuntu (and Debian) using apt-get:

1.  Install gnokii using apt-get:
    # apt-get install gnokii gnokii-smsd
2.  Edit /etc/gnokiirc
    # mcedit /etc/gnokiirc
    or
    # vi /etc/gnokiirc
    Note: usually you only need to edit the port and model part only
3.  Test your gnokii, plug in your cellphone/gsm modem cable to the computer, or
    connect via IrDA, and then type:
    # gnokii --identify
    Note: you should see gnokii identified your cellphone/gsm modem, if you dont
    see it, update your ~/.gnokiirc to suit your need
4.  Back to playSMS source directory, enter bin directory and copy gnokii_smsd_checker, 
    gnokii_smsd_incoming and gnokii_smsd_start to default directory
    # cd /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/bin
    # cp gnokii_smsd_checker gnokii_smsd_incoming gnokii_smsd_start /usr/local/bin/
5.  Look for rc.local on /etc and its subdirectories (usualy /etc, /etc/init.d or /etc/rc.d/init.d)
    Edit rc.local and put: 
    "/usr/local/bin/gnokii_smsd_start" (without quotes)
    on the bottom of the file (before exit if theres exit command). This way gnokii_smsd_start 
    will start automatically on boot. 
    Note: you need 'root' access to do this


II  Gnokii installation from source:

1.  Extract gnokii source package somewhere (eg: /usr/local/src)
2.  Configure it to make sure installation path is in /usr/local
    # ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
3.  Make and make install, these actions will install gnokii to /usr/local
    # make
    # make install
4.  Enter directory named 'smsd' in gnokii source directory, compile and install smsd
    Note: if you use gnokii version < 0.6.0 you'll have to make libfile.so not libfile.la
    # cd smsd
    # make
    # make libfile.la
    # make install
    # ln -s /usr/local/bin/smsd /usr/sbin/smsd
    Note: for those whose having trouble compiling smsd will have to edit the
    Makefile file manually, insert comments mark on libmysql.so and libpq.so part,
    another important note is to link (ln -s) /usr/local/bin/smsd to /usr/sbin/smsd
5.  Copy Docs/gnokiirc to /etc/gnokiirc, and edit it:
    # cd ../Docs/
    # cp gnokiirc /etc/gnokiirc
    # mcedit /etc/gnokiirc
    or
    # vi /etc/gnokiirc
    Note: usually you only need to edit the port and model part only
6.  Test your gnokii, plug in your cellphone/gsm modem cable to the computer, or
    connect via IrDA, and then type:
    # gnokii --identify
    Note: you should see gnokii identified your cellphone/gsm modem, if you dont
    see it, update your ~/.gnokiirc to suit your need
7.  Back to playSMS source directory, enter bin directory and copy gnokii_smsd_checker, 
    gnokii_smsd_incoming and gnokii_smsd_start to default directory
    # cd /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/bin
    # cp gnokii_smsd_checker gnokii_smsd_incoming gnokii_smsd_start /usr/local/bin/
8.  Look for rc.local on /etc and its subdirectories (usualy /etc, /etc/init.d or /etc/rc.d/init.d)
    Edit rc.local and put: 
    "/usr/local/bin/gnokii_smsd_start" (without quotes)
    on the bottom of the file (before exit if theres exit command). This way gnokii_smsd_start 
    will start automatically on boot. 
    Note: you need 'root' access to do this

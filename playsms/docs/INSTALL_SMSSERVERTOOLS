2.  Enter the extracted source codes directory and execute make to compile followed
    by installing smstools3

	# cd /usr/local/src/smstools3
	# make
	# make install

    Please note that you should be already install the C compiler and other related
    libraries required by smstools3. One easy step to do this in Ubuntu (or Debian)
    is by running this command before smstools3 installation:

	# apt-get install build-essential

4.  Back to playSMS source directory, copy smsd.conf from contrib/smstools/ to /etc

	# cd <playsms source codes directory>
	# cp contrib/smstools/smsd.conf /etc/

    with most wavecom modems with Serial to USB converter

6.  Create important directories for smstools3

	# mkdir -p /var/spool/sms
	# cd /var/spool/sms
	# mkdir checked failed incoming outgoing sent

	# mkdir -p /var/spool/smsbackup
	# cd /var/spool/smsbackup
	# mkdir checked failed incoming outgoing sent
	
	# mkdir -p /var/log/sms/stats

7.  Change permissions on some directories so that web server user can write files on it

	# chmod -R 775 /var/spool/sms /var/spool/smsbackup
	or
	# chown -R root:www-data /var/spool/sms /var/spool/smsbackup

    Please note that on some Linux distribution the web server user is 'apache' instead
    of 'www-data'

8.  Enter playSMS from web and login as administrator user and activate Gateway smstools

Note if you are using Ubuntu or Debian and alike:
- To get smstools3 running automatically on every boot, type this command:
    # update-rc.d sms3 defaults

UPGRADE
-------
Upgrade to playSMS version 0.9.9 from unmodified playSMS version 0.9.8

Please note, it is assumed that your old playSMS was installed this way:
- Your playSMS 0.9.8 web location is in /var/www/playsms/
- Your playSMS 0.9.8 daemon files location are in /usr/local/bin/
- Your playSMS 0.9.8 database name is playsms

Also note, it is assumed that your new playSMS was extracted at:
- /usr/local/src/playsms-0.9.9

Follow below steps carefully to upgrade from unmodified 0.9.8 to 0.9.9:

Stop playsmsd and sendsmsd:

/etc/init.d/playsms stop

1. Move and backup old files:

	mkdir -p /root/backup
	cd /root/backup
	mkdir www bin etc db
	mv /var/www/playsms/* www/
	mv /usr/local/bin/playsms* /usr/local/bin/sendsms* bin/
	mysqldump -uroot -p playsms --add-drop-table > db/playsms.sql
	cp /etc/default/playsms etc/playsms
	cp /etc/init.d/playsms etc/playsms.init

2. Quick install new files:

	cd /usr/local/src/playsms-0.9.9
	cp -rR web/* /var/www/playsms/
	cp -rR daemon/linux/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
	cp /root/backup/www/config.php /var/www/playsms/

3. Update database:

	cd /usr/local/src/playsms-0.9.9
	mysql -uroot -p playsms < db/playsms-upgrade-098-to-099.sql

Start again playsmsd and sendsmsd:

/etc/init.d/playsms start

Upgrade complete, browse playSMS as usual.

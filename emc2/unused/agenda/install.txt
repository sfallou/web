1. Basic installation
======================
To install the simple php-agenda you can follow these steps:

- You'll need a webserver or webhosting with php support and a MySQL database.
- (optional) Create a MySQL database for the agenda.
- (optional) Create a database user for the agenda.
- Copy the contents of the zip file to a directory on your webspace or webserver.
- Put the correct settings in config.inc.php
- Run the install.php script
- When there are no warning or errors, the agenda is created and correctly installed
- IMPORTANT: Delete install.php! The script does not check if there is already an agenda installed and you could accidently overwrite a previous install.
- IMPORTANT: Delete the 'update' directory. This directory contains script used to update from previous versions. These script alter the database, which may be unwanted in your installation.

2. Installing automatic mailing
===============================
The automatic reminders require you to install a script as a cron job.
The two scripts that should be included as cron jobs are:
- engine/sendreminders.php (this script should typically be invoked every few minutes)
- engine/senddailyreminder.php (this script should be invoked early in the morning, once a day)
- you also need to set the variable $enableReminder to true to allow users to set reminders on the appointments

Typically you can call a php-script from cron using one of the following methods:
a) wget http://yourhost.com/engine/sendreminders.php
b) curl http://yourhost.com/engine/sendreminders.php
c) lynx -dump http://yourhost.com/engine/sendreminders.php
d) /usr/local/bin/php /home/username/httpdocs/engine/sendreminders.php

For more info on how to set up cron jobs on your hosting, you should use google as this is platform dependend.



3. Updating an existing installation
====================================
To update an installation:
- Copy the contents of the zip file over your existing installation. Be carefull not to overwrite the configuration file.
- When it is a major update, go to the update folder in you installation. For example: http://localhost/agenda/update/
- Choose the appropriate update script and click it. These script immediatly run without any warnings or confirmations!
- Remove the 'update' directory and the install.php file. These files may have unwanted effect afterwards.
- Also execute the steps you need from point 2 in this manual
